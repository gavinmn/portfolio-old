						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Project</h2>

					<div class="case-study-body-container-center">
						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Problem</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">The core user experience was powerful but overly complicated, and the app lacked any branding and logo to tie everything together. I was brought on to solve the core UX issue, and to create an identity for Chalk.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Role</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I assumed the role of a freelance product designer for this challenge, often meeting in person and over the phone with one of the CEO's of Chalk as well as with their lead developer.</p>

					<div class="case-study-body-container-center">
						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Solution</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">There are three core modes to Chalk's group chat functionality. A text mode where the app functions as any regular messaging service, a voice mode that can be entered to connect with your friends with direct voice communication, and a listen mode where you can hear your friends talking but your microphone is not turned on.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I worked with Chalk to design a method to make navigating these modes easy for the user, centering all mode switching around one action button in the bottom left corner of the screen. By default the user stars in text mode, and can tap the action button to reveal options to switch into voice mode, or listen mode.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Once in a new mode, the UI is updated to reflect their mode, and provide contextual options such as muting the microphone in voice mode, or adjusting the amount of time left to idle in listen mode.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">User Research</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">User research conducted on the initial UX of the app showed that users were having trouble figuring out how to use the core features of Chalk, and that once they learned, were struggling to use it efficiently.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">These findings shaped how I thought about the solution. My goal was to make Chalk's primary features discoverable, intuitive, and efficient for the end user.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Early Iterations and Prototypes</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I started working on this design challenge by taking a step back from the initial UX and sketching out wireframes of completely new ideas. These rough sketches helped us hone in on a high level user flow while worrying about the small details later.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Medium and High Fidelity Work</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">After reviewing these early ideas with Chalk and discussing what worked and what didn't work, I moved onto creating medium fidelity mockups and prototypes to investigate how some details of the UX might look and feel.</p>

				<div class="case-study-text-flex">
					<div class="case-study-body-container-center">
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">These prototypes led to the eventual solution, and later, finishing touch details. I spent time designing the primary icons for the UI to signify different modes of communication, and worked with the team on refining details such as having the users's message bubbles change color in accordance with the set mode.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Brand</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Designing the iOS app icon was something I worked on concurrently. My process was very similar to the design of the core UX flow. I started with rough sketches of all kinds of different ideas and narrowed down on what Chalk liked and what fit the message they were trying to convey with their brand.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">From here I moved into high fidelity mockups, making over one hundred iterations of a core idea to arrive at the finalized end product.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">The final icon was eventually used as primary action button in the core UX to tie the brand design and the UI together.</p>
