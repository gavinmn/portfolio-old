						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Project</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I completed a redesign of Slapdash's branding during the fall and winter of 2019 to help their brand better align with their product values for their version 1.0 launch.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Problem</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text"> Slapdash's tagline, "Think at the speed of thought," was not accurately reflected in their previous logo. I was asked to take the basic idea of their previous logo, and redesign it in a way that better reflected their company ideals.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I was fully responsible for brand design throughout every stage of this process, often recieving feedback from Slapdash as I shared progress both over Slack and on site with the four person local team.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Solution</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">The final brand uses two transparent overlapping rectangles to create a subtle S. Slapdash as a product aims to be your one stop shop for all of your online services, acting as an easy to query file browser, communication log, collaboration hub, and more. Their company mission is to make using their personal data aggregator as fast and as seamless as possible. I chose to incorporate neon colors to give the logo a modern, fast feel, while the overlapping element represents the blending of the user's scattered online data.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I set the Slapdash word mark in the typeface Eina 02 to evoke a similar modern sense of speed while maintaining liveliness. I felt that the slanted terminals of the <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> as well as the curved tails on letters such as <i>l</i> and <i>a</i> helped evoke this feeling.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Prior User Research</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Before I joined this project, Slapdash was putting their product in front of as many eyes as they could to gather feedback. When specifically asked about the logo, early users were reporting that it felt disconnected from the rest of the product. This fit the company's feeling that the logo felt like a placeholder while they further developed their core product.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Early Explorations</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">To begin the design process for this branding project, I started by getting a feel for their platform and sketching out some ideas for potential icons. During this stage of the design process I try to sketch any idea that comes to mind to not narrow down the scope of possibilities.</p>

					<div class="case-study-body-container-center">
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Since this was a relatively simple logo, I took the project to the high fidelity stage quickly as I was still able to rapidly iterate. These high fidelity mockups allowed me to work out details and have a frame of reference for further discussions with Slapdash.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Finishing Touches and Type</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">After presenting my higher fidelity mockups to Slapdash, there were some designs that stood out to them that I further worked on to make sure we were happy with every detail. At this point I started testing out different typefaces and looking at how they interacted with the logo. With hundreds of iterations in the books, I arrived at the final logo and word mark that Slapdash was proud to launch version 1.0 with.</p>
