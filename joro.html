						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Project</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I was asked to help Joro with the creation of their iPhone app by designing their information and user interface architecture.

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Problem</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Joro had rough sketches and mockups of their carbon offset flow but needed me to adjust the visual hierarchy and produce high fidelity mockups for their engineering team. I then needed to apply this styling and IA structure to an undeveloped give a gift flow.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Solution</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Joro's mission is to help reduce carbon emissions by making it easy for users to purchase carbon offsets. I felt it was important to make the carbon offset and give a gift user flows sleek, simple, and informative for the user.</br></br>The final user interface relies heavliy on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Sticking to the HIG relativly tightly gave the app a very fast and native feel and made it easier for the Joro engineers to quickly implement.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Before I joined this project, Joro had conducted preliminary user research to get an idea of what potential users already knew about carbon emissions, and to test some low fidelity user flows.</br></br>The users showed interest in knowing how they were helping the envirnoment through Joro and as always, exactly how much they were paying and for what.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I began this restructuring by digging into what work Joro already had and thinking about how to make the user flows clear, educational, and intuitive. I marked up the screens, and sketched out a few new ideas to present to Joro.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I took these mockups, notes, and ideas to Joro to discuss what they felt were the most important pieces of information to highlight based on user research. After picking their brains, I dove into creating a system of information hierarchy through font styles and UI work focusing on clarity of information.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">After presenting my higher fidelity mockups to Slapdash, there were some designs that stood out to them that I further worked on to make sure we were happy with every detail. At this point I started testing out different typefaces and looking at how they interacted with the logo. With hundreds of iterations in the books, I arrived at the final logo and wordmark that Slapdash was proud to launch version 1.0 with.</p>
