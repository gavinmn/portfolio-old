						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Project</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Joro's mission is to help reduce carbon emissions by making it easy for users to purchase carbon offsets. I was asked to help Joro with the creation of their iPhone app by designing their information and user interface architecture. I worked on these design sprints during the fall of 2019, making high fidelity mockups of their Purchase Carbon Offset user flow, and created their Give a Gift user flow.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Problem</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Joro had rough sketches and mockups of their carbon offset flow but needed me to adjust the visual hierarchy and produce high fidelity mockups for their engineering team. I then needed to apply this styling and IA structure to an undeveloped give a gift flow.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Role</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I assumed the role of a freelance product designer for this project, meeting with Joro over video conference and discussing the project via email. I was responsible for all information and user interface wireframes, as well as for all high fidelity mockups of the Carbon Offset and Give a Gift user flows.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Solution</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I felt it was important to make the carbon offset and give a gift user flows sleek, simple, and informative for the user.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">The final user interface relies heavily on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Sticking to the HIG relatively tightly gave the app a very fast and native feel and made it easier for the Joro engineers to quickly implement.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I worked with an 8pt grid system to keep items in alignment. In my experience not only does this make implementing the designs faster, but it keep things looking professional and cohesive - something that is important when designing a checkout flow. To engage users and add to their enjoyment of the app, I left space for screens to feature custom illustrations - something I discussed collaborating on with Joro in the future.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Prior User Research</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Before I joined this project, Joro had conducted preliminary user research to get an idea of what potential users already knew about carbon emissions, and to test some low fidelity user flows.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">The users showed interest in knowing how they were helping the environment through Joro and as always, exactly how much they were paying and for what.</p>

						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Process</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I began this restructuring by digging into what work Joro already had and thinking about how to make the user flows clear, educational, and intuitive. I marked up the screens, and sketched out a few new ideas to present to Joro.</p><p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I took these mockups, notes, and ideas to Joro to discuss what we felt were the most important pieces of information to highlight based on user research. After picking their brains, I dove into creating a system of information hierarchy through font styles and UI work focusing on clarity of information. At the end of my design sprint, I had created a design system based off of Joro's medium fidelity mockups that gave their app a clear structure and hierarchy. With this design system I was able to create a new user flow from scratch, demonstrating to Joro how the same could be done for future development of their app.</p>
