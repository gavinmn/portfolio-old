						<h2 class="case-study-h2 bold-text light-grey-text">Solution</h2>
						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Joro's mission is to help reduce carbon emissions by making it easy for users to purchase carbon offsets. I felt it was important to make the carbon offset user flow sleek, simple, and informative for the user.</br></br>The final user interface relies heavliy on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Sticking to the HIG relativly tightly gave the app a very fast and native feel and made it easier for the Joro engineers to quickly implement.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">Before joining this project, Joro had conducted preliminary user research to get an idea of what potential users already knew about carbon emissions, and to test some low fidelity user flows.</br></br>Looking at this information, it was clear that the UI should be clear about education and price. The users showed interest in knowing how they were helping the envirnoment through Joro and as always, exactly how much they were paying and for what.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">To begin the design process for this branding project, I started by getting a feel for their platform and sketching out some ideas for potential icons.

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">After presenting my higher fidelity mockups to Slapdash, there were some designs that stood out to them that I further worked on to make sure we were happy with every detail. At this point I started testing out different typefaces and looking at how they interacted with the logo. With hundreds of iterations in the books, I arrived at the final logo and wordmark that Slapdash was proud to launch version 1.0 with.</p>
