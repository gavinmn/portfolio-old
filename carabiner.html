						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">For the final project in ME 203, students are required to design, prototype, and machine a multi part, functional item that required the use of the manual milling machine, lathe, sand casting foundry, or MIG welder. Students are taught to use fundamentals of design thinking and design prototyping as they worked their way from low fidelity mockups to a final hand machined high fidelity item.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">For my final product, I milled a spring loaded carabiner out of 6061 aluminum. The project took ten weeks in which I was taught machining and design prototyping by Professor David Beach in Stanford's Product Realization Lab.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">I was taught the importance of starting the design process very low fidelity to allow for rapid iteration and prototyping. I completed hundreds of idea sketches and constantly tweaked low and medium fidelity prototypes throughout the early stages of this project - something I would not have had the time to do if I had rushed to the high fidelity phase.</p>

Early prototypes were made out of particle board and hot glue and designed to be easy to rapidly make and adjust.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">After further ideation and design sketching, I took my learnings from the early prototypes and applied them to a medium fidelity prototype. The goal of this stage was to create a functioning mechanism for the carabiner. I laser cut C shaped frames to test out different ways of connecting a spring to the carabiner's gate. This was also the stage in which I tested out different dimensions for the final product. Designing in medium fidelity allowed me to work on details of the future final project - something the low fidelity "idea" prototypes were often too rough around the edges for.</p>

						<p class="body-text case-study-body dark-grey-text">At this stage of the project, I was able to make final, slight dimension and tolerance adjustments to my CAD specification sheet and solidify an order of operations for the piece. It was important to take a step back to low fidelity thinking at this point to sketch out exactly how the piece needed to be placed in the mill machine, and an exact order of machine operations to use. From this point, I followed my specifications with a high attention to detail and operated the mill machine to create a final product.</p>
